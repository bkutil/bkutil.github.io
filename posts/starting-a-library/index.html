      <h1> Starting a library </h1>

      <p></p>

<p>In the true spirit of I-don&rsquo;t-know-what-I&rsquo;m-doing-but-let&rsquo;s-have-fun, I
started a <a href="https://mtkp.cz/en/">small technical library</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%ADsek">Pisek</a>,
the town <a href="https://www.google.cz/maps/place/397+01+Pisek/@49.3066419,14.1482797,14z">where</a> I live.</p>

<p>The idea is to provide access to English IT/Engineering books, that are
otherwise hard to come by.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-technical-library">Why a technical library?</h2>

<p>It is an attempt to solve an availability problem, money problem and a
personal problem.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-it-literature">Access to IT literature</h3>

<p>Czech republic has an excellent <a href="https://www.techlib.cz/en/">National Technical
Library</a>, located in it&rsquo;s capital.</p>

<p>However, towns around the country don&rsquo;t have anything similar on
a smaller scale. IT books are either missing, or they are about a
specific release of a single software, and thus, obsolete after a few years -
think <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/156884932X">Word For Windows 95 For Dummies</a>.</p>

<p>We sorely need access to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033844/">textbooks</a> and books that
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735611319">explain concepts</a> in an excellent way, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521663504/">document
state-of-the-art</a> at a given point in time, and thus, are essentially
timeless.</p>

<h3 id="these-books-are-expensive">These books are expensive</h3>

<p>I mean <em>really</em> expensive.</p>

<p>The median income in the Czech republic is around 23 thousand CZK, or
about 850 EUR. A book like Okasaki&rsquo;s Purely functional data structures
starts at 50 EUR.</p>

<p>This is probably OK for companies, but there are not many individuals
who can afford or want to spend 5% of their monthly income on a single
paperback. Much less students, who&rsquo;d benefit from the access the
most.</p>

<h3 id="starting-an-it-community-in-pisek">Starting an IT community in Pisek</h3>

<p>I moved to Pisek two years ago. As far as I know, there are no signs of
any IT community, regular meetups, lightning talks or book clubs.</p>

<p>For me, it was always a lot of fun organising events and bringing people
together, be it Codemonkeys - a monthly meetup of programmer friends in
Prague, or <a href="https://github.com/Plnt/lightning-lizards">Lightning Lizards</a>
semi-regular lightning talks at SUSE.</p>

<p>So I think it&rsquo;d be great to have a place to hang out and chat with other
programmers from Pisek, talk about ideas, latest tech, or even business
opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="taking-a-shot-at-fixing-the-problem">Taking a shot at fixing the problem</h2>

<p>There are few ways I can think of how to fix these problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Support publishing and translations into Czech.</p></li>

<li><p>Import the literature, promote, and re-sell it.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide access to the books for free and let people who can read
English explain, teach, and show the subject to others.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first two are slow, expensive and don&rsquo;t really solve the high-price
problem.  Actually, they almost sound like strawmen, don&rsquo;t they? A local
library and/or book club feels like a good way to go.</p>

<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll try to dig a bit more into the &lsquo;how&rsquo; of things
and the progress so far.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes&hellip; Keep fingers crossed.</p>
